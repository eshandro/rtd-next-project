RTD has 2 feeds available: GTFS and GTFS-Realtime. Currently the realtime feed is only available for buses.

Info about static feeds: https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/
RTD's static feed files are here: http://www.rtd-denver.com/GoogleFeeder/google_transit.zip
You get a zip file with several .txt files. Need to parse and store as JSON/JS object. Also need to figure out how to set up CRON job to the zip file, unzip, parse, and update as needed.

Static Feed Light Rail Info:
-route_id = 101 + rail line for C, D, E, F, H, e.g. 101C
-route_id = 103W  for W line
-route_id = A for A-line to airport
-route_id = 113B for B Line
-route_id = 107R for R Line
-route_id = 109L for L Line (new line starting 1/4/18 - affects D Line; D Line will stop at 18th and the L Line will 
            be a seperate line that takes over the D Line's 18th & Stout to 30th and Downing stretch. The L Line will 
            also do a loop 14th - 19th on California and on Stout. Stops will be at 16th & 18th at the existing stops 
            for the D, F, H Lines. The L Line will eventually connect up to the A Line at 38th and Downing.)

1/2018 10 light rail lines
-route_type = 0 includes 8 lines -- C,D,E,F,H,L,R,W
-route_type = 2 incluedes 2 lines -- A,B

- See 'updating denverrail tables' folder in the notes folder for more info from a previous person's use of static feed
- they used only trips, stop_times, and stops, which may be a good strategy here too.


You have to request access to the realtime feed urls:http://www.rtd-denver.com/gtfs-developer-guide.shtml#realtime-feeds

The realtime feed urls are:
1. Trip Updates - http://www.rtd-denver.com/google_sync/TripUpdate.pb
2. Vehicle positions - http://www.rtd-denver.com/google_sync/VehiclePosition.pb

Help on realtime feeds: https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/




Google Maps API has a Transit layer where you could display local routes etc: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/layer-transit, https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/trafficlayer
In theory, user could click on a line to get info about it or add it to their list of lines/routes.

*NOTE: Denver and RTD are listed as available on Google Transit, but Transit is greyed out on Google map of Denver? (https://www.google.com/landing/transit/cities/index.html)
