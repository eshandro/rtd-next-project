Each Route object has a list of Trips. Each Trip object has a list of Stop_Times and Stop_Times have a stop_id.

So, either through an aggregate db query or by just looping through the data, we should be able to build a list of stop_ids for a given route.

The stop_ids list would not be unique, so would need to figure out how to make the list only contain unique stop_ids.

Each Route object would then have a list of stop_ids as part of its model.


Routes with correct stops list
101C, 101D, 101E, 101F, 113B, A, 107R,

Routes with issues
101H -- stops out of order because curves back to the north
103W -- Auraria West and Bronco Stadium switched in order. And, on Eastbound Auraria West displays twice -- stop_id: 25427 & 25431 (this ID has the wrong direction)
	The 2nd issue is fixed by only returning unique stops from getStopsListByRouteAndDirection, which could have other consequences.
109L -- southbound only, 18th & Stout is before 20th & Welton
