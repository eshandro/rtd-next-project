Each Route object has a list of Trips. Each Trip object has a list of Stop_Times and Stop_Times have a stop_id.

So, either through an aggregate db query or by just looping through the data, we should be able to build a list of stop_ids for a given route.

The stop_ids list would not be unique, so would need to figure out how to make the list only contain unique stop_ids.

Each Route object would then have a list of stop_ids as part of its model.

(when sorted by stop_sequence)
Routes with correct stops list
101C, 101F, 113B, A, 107R, 109L

Routes with issues
101D -- On Southbound only, stops out of order -- caused by random times that Southbound D starts at Englewood instead of 18th & Stout 
101E -- On Southbound only, stops out of order -- caused by random times that Southbound E starts at Evans instead of Union Station 
101H -- On Southbound only, stops out of order -- caused by random times that Southbound H starts at Evans instead of Union Station 
103W -- On Eastbound only, Auraria West displays twice -- stop_id: 25427 & 25431 (last ID has the wrong direction and comes from trip_id: 112268609) This issue is fixed by only returning unique stops, but does this cause other issues?
